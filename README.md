## To Do a priori
1. STYLE *NavLinks* w/ghostly animation
2. UPDATE *FAQPage* as dictated by Jim.
3. ADD *PICTURES* or *PAST EVENTS* NavLink
  + Maybe in a DROPDOWN for *MORE INFO* or the like.

## To Do Yet
1. ADD 'sorting' algorithm to `filteredEvents()` w/in `src/components/EventsFile.js`
2. MOVE `EventsFile.js` into JSON or onto backend.
  1. Create and Wire up backend to frontend.
3. SET UP **backend** and Server using **NodeJS**.
4. SHOW **Capacity** for each Event, have it dynamically *count down*.

          "Thanks to all who took part in the <em>Aug. 15 inaugural Haunted Beijing tour</em>, led by supernaturalist Jim Nobles. Jim was a superb guide as we mingled with denizens of the spirit world on the night of the Hungry Ghost Festival. Spooky thunder and lightning kicked off the walk, and a swarm of bats filled the skies as we trod on Beijing's former execution grounds. Regrets that the tour was filled to capacity -- if you didn't respond early enough to snag a place, stay tuned: Jim will be crossing over to the dark side again in the not too distant future and you'll be invited to sign up -- if you dare."
